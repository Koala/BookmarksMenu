You can migrate bookmarks from older Bookmarks Menu extension to new one. 

Choose Tools - Migrate entry in the main menu of the Bookmarks window.
Converted entries are inserted under the Bookmarks folder. 

Bookmark This and Edit entries are ignored. And maybe there are some 
problem on conversion of older entries to new entries.
